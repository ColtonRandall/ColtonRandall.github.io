                My name is Colton, a proud dual citizen of two of the most beautiful countries in the world - Canada (my
                birthplace) and New Zealand (where I grew up). We moved to NZ in 1998, leaving behind all of our
                extended family in Vancouver. In my early years, I gravitated toward spending time with our new puppy,
                Nanook, and got my first playstation in 1999 (picture for proof), which was where my interest for
                technology started.

            Fast forward to 2013. I had just finished high-school and was experiencing the need to explore the world and
            what it had to offer. Luckily for me, I had an Aunt who was living and working in Rwanda. This acted as the
            opportunistic-fuel I needed to take a nose-dive into some volunteer experience.

            In Rwanda, I taught English at a local orphanage, and a nearby pre-school. It was a raw experience where I
            witnessed both the most amazing stories and people, along with frequently sombering reminders of how lucky I
            am. I later went back in 2016, this time to Kenya, to complete more volunteer work. I taught Maths and
            Physics at a high school in Kibera - the largest slum in Africa. Additionally, I worked as a healthcare
            assistant deeper in the slum to help local doctors treat the residants for Malaria and various respiratory
            infections. This inevitably encouraged an involvement in healthcare and Biology, which is where my first
            University degree came into play.

            I started my first degree at the University of Otago in 2015, taking a general Health Science program which
            involved completing eight interdisciplinary courses, dispersed throughout various degree programs and
            subjects. This was what introduced me to Biochemistry. It was something I never thought I'd enjoy, but the
            requirement to take it lead me to moulding it into a BSc, graduating in 2018.

            <p id="flyingContent">
            Toward the end of my degree, I decided to simultaneously take some flight lessons at a local aero club. This
            lead to my first ever solo flight - a childhood dream. I decided that I would enroll in a full-time course
            at a flight school to pursue a career as a pilot. I started in 2019, got my private license, then Covid-19
            spread across the globe. This global event and it's inevitable impact on the industry forced me to step
            back and reconsider this path.

            <div class="BioinformaticsDiv">
            During lockdown I took a bunch of online courses in programming, since my BSc in Biochemistry exposed me to a bit of it in the form of
            Bioinformatics - where programming is used to analyse biochemichal data. I loved it. Once lockdown ended, I managed
            to secure myself three jobs as a Bioinformatics Research Assistant, two at the University of Auckland and one at Landcare Reasearch. 
            This allowed me to get first-hand programming experience. I continued the conline courses and began slowly updating my GitHub profile with small projects. 
            

            Reaching out and making connections during these jobs helped me realise that a formal qualification in
            programming can not only compliment my BSc in Biochemistry, but open up many more doors than I initially
            thought. I enrolled in the postgraduate certificate in Information Technology at Auckland University, and
            I've been thoroughly enjoying the content taught thus far and the opportunities these skills can lead to.
