                My name is Colton, a proud dual citizen of two of the most beautiful countries in the world - Canada (my birthplace) and New Zealand (where I grew up). We moved to NZ in 1998, leaving behind all of our extended family in Vancouver. In my early years, I gravitated toward spending time with our new puppy, Nanook, and got my first playstation in 1999 (picture for proof), which was where my interest for technology started.

                Fast forward to 2013. I had just finished high-school and was experiencing the need to explore the world and what it had to offer. Luckily for me, I had an Aunt who was living and working in Rwanda. This acted as the opportunistic-fuel I needed to take a nose-dive into some volunteer experience. 


                <div id="rwanda1">
                    <img src="./website_attachments/images/rwanda1.jpg" id="rwanda1IMG">
                </div>
                 
        

                In Rwanda, I taught English at a local orphanage, and a nearby pre-school. It was a raw experience where I witnessed both the most amazing stories and people, along with frequently sombering reminders of how lucky I am. I later went back in 2016, this time to Kenya, to complete more volunteer work. I taught Maths and Physics at a high school in Kibera - the largest slum in Africa. Additionally, I worked as a healthcare assistant deeper in the slum to help local doctors treat the residants for Malaria and various respiratory infections. This inevitably encouraged an involvement in healthcare and Biology, which is where my first University degree came into play.

                <br>
                
                I started my first degree at the University of Otago in 2015, taking a general Health Science program which involved completing eight interdisciplinary courses, dispersed throughout various degree programs and subjects. This was what introduced me to Biochemistry. It was sonething I never thought I'd enjoy, but the requirement to take it lead me to moulding it into a BSc, graduating in 2018.

                <br>
                <br>
                Toward the end of my degree, I decided to simultaneously take some flight lessons at a local aero club. This lead to my first ever solo flight - a childhood dream. I decided that I would enroll in a full-time course at a flight school to pursue a career as a pilot. I started in 2019, got my private license, then Covid-19 spread across the globe. This global event and it's inevitable impact on the industry allowed me to step back and reconsider this path.

                <br>
                <br>
                During lockdown I took a bunch of online courses in programming, since my BSc in Biochemistry exposed me to Bioinformatics - where programming and Biochemistry intertwine. I loved it. Once lockdown ended, I managed to secure myself two jobs at the University of Auckland as a Bioinformatics Research Assistant, which allowed me to get first-hand experience in this area.

                Reaching out and making connections during these jobs helped me realise that a formal qualification in programming can not only compliment my BSc in Biochemistry, but open up many more doors than I initially thought. I enrolled in the postgraduate certificate in Information Technology at Auckland University, and I've been thoroughly enjoying the content taught thus far and the opportunities these skills can lead to.
